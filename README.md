# Keyphrase_Detection : Identifying Key Phrases in Real World Patient Notes
This repository contains the data and algorithm I have created for my Master Thesis on the topic "Identifying Key Phrases in Real World Patient Notes". 

The two datasets used for this research are NBME / USMLE dataset and VAERS dataset, both of them are uploaded in the repository. 

The files can be read and executed sequentually
1. KeyBERT with xxxx where xxxx are the custom embedding models used
2. Evaluation file which describes which threshold and model is selected
3. VAERS dataset algorithm check
